Looking for a quick way to visualize all 46 of the Adirondack High Peaks? This poster might be for you! Indeed, the print distills a wealth of data into a format similar to the Periodic Table of Elements. Given for each summit is a difficulty rating, elevation in feet and meters, elevation rank, summit type, trail type, county, and region. Region colors reflect the 2020 re-zoning of the High Peaks by the NY Department of Enviornmental Conservation, while subtle shading differences preserve historic boundaries. To accommodate our Québecois friends to the north, the poster's legend is translated into French. Chapeau, randonneurs francophones!! Offset-printed on 80lb paper with an endurance gloss cover.
