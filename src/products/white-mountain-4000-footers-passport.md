A complement to the <a href='/products/periodic-table-of-white-mountain-4000-footers/'>Periodic Table of the White Mountain 4000-Footers poster</a>, this pocket-size passport is tailor-made for tracking of your 4000-footer climbs. Bound with a handsome dark blue leatherette cover, it includes a page for each of the 48 peaks on which to log date, companions and hike notes. Included are two sets of small peel-off stamps for each peak&mdash;one to place on the individual peak page, and another to place on the two-page centerspread to track your overall progress in climbing the &quot;48&quot;. The stamps are referenced to a peak abbreviation key on the back page of the passport, using the same format as the poster. A portion of this product's profits go directly to the [AMC Four Thousand Footer Club](http://www.amc4000footer.org/).
