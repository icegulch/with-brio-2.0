      Hi, MainStreeters! Thanks for taking the time to review my portfolio.

      Below, I'm including examples of my work that seem relevant to what you're seeking in a Product Designer. Things are not necessarily in chronological order, but I've included dates in the captions so you get a sense of recency.

    <h2>
      UI Design
    </h2>

      While much of my work hasn't been distilled into a proper design system, I do strive to design with an eye toward consistency and clarity. One of my favorite UI projects was the Heavybit Industries website design, which is largely <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/" target="_blank">still in use today</a>. I designed every template on the site, working with their talented frontend dev to bring the comps to life.

      I'm a fan of fast-loading websites and apps, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to increase page speed while respecting brand identity guidelines. In the case of <a href="https://www.cartalk.com/car-donation/" target="_blank">Car Talk's Vehicle Donation Program</a>, I managed to get their page speed scores up to 96-99% on mobile by strategically using tricks like CSS gradients, inline SVGs, and the Jamstack.

      Like many designers, I'm regularly tasked with taking an existing application and "making it better". In the case of FEMA's flood insurance portal below, it boiled down to simple things like <a href="/images/portfolio/ui-ux/fema-before.png" target="_blank">not making everything look like a button</a> and imposing a predictable hierarchy. I often end up re-using UI elements in <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJw9u8nGNwP8sFZFMCyDqWNR1XnmzkpR" target="_blank">product videos</a> they subsequently request.

      When it comes to concepts and prototypes, there's so much that ends up on the cutting room floor.

      When time or budget is a constraint, I do enjoy jumping into a repo and just doing my best in code.

      In 2015, I created a "periodic table" of New Hampshire's 4000-foot mountains with the intention of printing it for one or two friends. One of those friends encouraged me to sell them, so I took a chance and did what seemed like a huge print run of 500 copies. They sold out in a matter of weeks. Since then, I've expanded the concept, produced a series of hiking passports, and created a letterpress line. One thing is for sure: I've learned a lot about how to use variable data in Adobe Illustrator.

      I'm glad I chose to wholesale these products, as working directly with retailers is a great way to get real feedback&mdash;the analytics of print design. My sister, who handles fulfillment back home, is great at cataloguing happy users (a few of whom are featured below). We donate a portion of the profits to local trail groups and offer scores of "duds" to addiction recovery programs.

      As mentioned above, I've only had a few opportunities to distill design patterns into a formal design system. In each case, I teamed up with fellow designers to produce the final deliverables, from responsive UIs to whiskey flasks.
