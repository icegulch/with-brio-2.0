      Hi, MainStreeters! Thanks for taking the time to review my portfolio. To spare you a lot of clicking, I'm dropping all examples onto this single page and hoping that lazy-loading will prevent your browser from crashing.

      I'm including examples of my work that seem relevant to what you're seeking in a Product Designer. Things are not necessarily in chronological order, but I've included dates in the captions to give you a sense of recency.

    <h2>
      UI Design

      While many of the projects I've worked on haven't required formal design systems (or haven't had budgets for them), I do strive to design with an eye toward consistency and clarity. The Greenpeace Chrome Extension above was a fun challenge, for we wanted it to load fast in the tiny space provided while still having some semblance of aesthetic appeal.

      One of my favorite UI projects was the Heavybit Industries website design in 2014, which is largely <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/" target="_blank">still in use today</a>. I designed every template on the site, working with their talented frontend dev to bring the mocks to life.

      I'm a fan of fast-loading websites and apps, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to increase page speed while respecting brand identity guidelines. In the case of <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cartalk.com%2Fcar-donation%2Fcalifornia%2F" target="_blank">Car Talk's Vehicle Donation Program</a>, I managed to get their page speed scores up to 96-99% on mobile by strategically using CSS gradients, inline SVGs, and the Jamstack.

      Like many designers, I'm regularly tasked with taking an existing application and "making it better". In the case of FEMA's flood insurance portal below, it boiled down to simple things like <a href="/images/portfolio/ui-ux/fema-before.png" target="_blank">not making everything look like a button</a> and imposing a predictable hierarchy. In two cases, I've repurposed the UI elements in user-focused <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJw9u8nGNwP8sFZFMCyDqWNR1XnmzkpR" target="_blank">product videos</a>.

      When it comes to concepts and prototypes, there's a lot that ends up on the cutting room floor. Below are a few examples.

      When time or budget is a constraint, I enjoy jumping into a repo and just doing my level best <em>in code</em>.

      Print Design

      In 2015, I created a "periodic table" of New Hampshire's 4000-foot mountains with the intention of gifting it to one or two friends. One of those friends encouraged me to sell them, so I took a chance and paid for a <em>daunting</em> print run of 500 copies. They sold out in a matter of weeks. Since then, I've <a href="https://withbr.io" target="_blank">expanded the concept</a>, produced a series of hiking passports, and created a letterpress line. I've learned a lot about how to use variable data in Adobe Illustrator!

      I'm glad I chose to wholesale these products. Working directly with retailers is a great way to get real feedback&mdash;the analytics of print design. My favorite "analytics" are photos of beaming kids with their passport sticker pages filled out! I donate a portion of profits to local trail groups and give away "duds" to addiction recovery programs.

      As mentioned above, I've only had a few opportunities to distill design patterns into a formal design system. In each case, I teamed up with super-talented designers / illustrators to produce the final deliverables, from responsive UIs to conference swag.
